# Player Profile Dashboard

This project is an implementation of a basketball player statistics dashboard for the University of Kentucky's CS499 Senior Design Project class.

We used the Python Dash framework in collaboration with [Ludis Analytics](https://www.ludisanalytics.com/) data and statistics platform as our tech stack.
